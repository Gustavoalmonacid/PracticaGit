Build Our Machine(Dagames)


They have sent you a letter
To come back home to play
But to your dismay
This isn't your day
For the happy fun time has begun to fade
Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned
We're dismantled, we're mishandled
But we won't be skipped and swayed

Trapped within these walls
You left our souls to drip away
The ink decays, the walls at bay
But the reckoning has come today
You say
Boris has no guts 'cause you replaced it with mechanical strain
We've been tortured but we move forward
This disorder kills your day!

I am alive, immortalized
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now, you must build up our machine
You die tonight, tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight, tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight

So, you found all the pieces to initiate the pain
Our venom stains, the night remains
But the ending is always just the same, no gain
Nod your head to the beat of death
As you draw your last eternal breath
Sensations of an invasion start to course right through your veins

You say we have no brains
We're just cartoons for your portrayal
To tell some tale about a boat and sail
But sure, this inevitably unveils the fail
Splashes of eternal hate will flood the floor and clean your slate
Now, we're the tools and you're the fool
Our nightmare dominates!

I am alive, immortalized
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now, you must build up our machine
You die tonight
I am alive, immortalized
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now, you must build up our machine
You die tonight, tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight, tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight

I am aware
That your soul is now divine
We care to not toil with unbroken chains
So don't toil with ours like he did to our shining stars
So prepare for adventure
We're a whole new creature from the darkest side
You can't take away the pain we feel
Created as monsters that come to life!
(Come back to life)

So, you've come to the end now
Alive but dead inside
The heart beats loud
You've joined our crowd
We are but punished serpentines
Your life with him was fun
But now the terror's only just begun
Now come with me and you will see
We're a new-born cyanide!

I am alive, immortalized
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now you must build up our machine
You die tonight
I am alive, immortalized
You're the creator, you traitor
Hey! There's no vaccine to cure our dirty needs
For now you must build up our machine
You die tonight, tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight, tonight!
Build up our machine
You die tonight
